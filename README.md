# Quiet, Silent Void Hub's official Discord server's bot
Created by TheV0rtex.

# Setting it up
To get Quiet's awesome code working on your own bot, simply follow these steps:

1. Run `$ node initializer.js`.
2. Fill in the "config.json" file generated.
3. Run `$ node core.js`.

# Text files
In order for the `$rules` and `$link` commands, as well as the welcome message to work, change their value to `true` in  the "config.json" file, then fill in the following files:
- "rules.md", located in the "members" plugin.
- "welcome.md", located in the "members" plugin.
- "links.json", located in the "links" plugin.

# New features

# Quiet, Silent Void Hub's official Discord server's bot
Created by TheV0rtex.

# Setting it up
To get Quiet's awesome code working on your own bot, simply follow these steps:

1. Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`.
2. Fill in the config file.
3. Run `$ node Quiet.js`.

# Text files
If you wish to use the `$rules` command, simply rename `rules.md.example` to `rules.md` and fill it in.
Same goes with the `welcome.md.example` file, if you want your bot to send a welcome message when a member joins your server.
Do the same with `points.json.example`. There is already a link set by default, serving as a template.

# New features
I will updating Quiet whenever I have major command breakthroughs. If you have any interesting new features you'd like to see implemented in Quiet, you are warmly welcomed to make a **pull request** on this repo.

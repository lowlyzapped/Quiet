**1 - **Don't be rude. Pretty simple. Don't abuse other members, don't start arguments, don't troll. You get the point.
**2 -** No self harm or self destructive behaviour. We are not trained to deal with it and as such it's better you get the help you need. It would be better for all of us.
**3 -** No shameless self promotion or spamming of other discord links.
**4 -** Relating again to Rule 1, creeping, harassment or bullying are not tolerated here. There are no warnings. You WILL be banned. If you feel you are being harassed or bullied, PM an admin immediately.         We will take it seriously.
**5 -** Keep the channels on topic. If you see someone leaving the right path, please guide them politely to the correct channels. If there are any problems, call an admin. Memes go in #memes-n-spam.
**6 -** No spam. Ever.
**7 -** NSFW will NOT be tolerated. This includes gore, nudity, etc.
**8 -** No piracy or anything that is against Discord's Terms Of Services.
**9 -** No ear rape and annoying voice modifications in voice channels.

We are pretty chill admins, but we keep the right to delete comments and links, as well as banning people at our discretion.
